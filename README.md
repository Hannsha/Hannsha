## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Hannsha/Hannsha** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi there! I’m a senior at SIUE majoring in Mass Communications with a minor in Applied Communications. I’m a Resident Assistant and a Cougar Ambassador, so I spend a lot of time working with people, building community, and staying involved on campus. I’m always learning more about communication, media, and creative ways to tell stories that actually connect with others. I’m open to collaborating on creative or communication focused projects and love staying busy and trying new things.
